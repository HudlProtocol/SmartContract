HUDL Protocol

The HUDL Protocol is a token based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain project dedicated to reward holders of the $HUDL token with opportunities to make an Universal Basic Income (UBI) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income).

A Burn function is added to reduce the supply further making it a deflationary currency, We also added a liquidity providing function to support larger trade sizes for HUDL Protocol as the number of holders increases.

Additionally, A Static reflection function is implemented with every trade watch your balance of $HUDL grow indefinitely, All you have to do is hold and earn and keep make some transaction.

Reflection (2%)
$HUDL Works having no interface needed to claim the fees. No action needs to be taken on the part of the holder other than to hold $HUDL in a wallet they control. With $HUDL, there are no vaults that could be hacked and drained or treasury funds that could be mismanaged. There is only the free market. 

Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the smart contract and are immediately reflected in the holder's balance. Furthermore, the fees are considerably higher than most reflect tokens ensuring a steady supply of passive income for all holders.

Burn Fee (1%)
$HUDL will allow token holders to further increase income as every transaction that occurs as a token burn applied to it, This is a modest tax of 1%, along with the reflect function these should propose a more streamlined investment for holders since the move is for deflationary purposes i.e boosting the value of each token by reducing existing supply.


Liquidity Fee (5%)
A premium conducted on all trades leads to 5% of all transactions reflected into the liquidity pool to support the future of $HUDL. This will help guarantee bigger trades requiring less slippage in the future were once discovered by the larger investors it is needed the most.

LP Reward Fee (1%)
LP Reward fees will be deducted coming from every transaction amount of one percent go to LP Reward pool.
